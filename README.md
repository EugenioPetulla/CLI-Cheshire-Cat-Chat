# CLI-Cheshire-Cat-Chat

Welcome to the Cheshire Cat CLI Chat Interface! This interface allows you to chat with [The Cheshire Cat](https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat), a customizable AI framework.
. 

## Installation

To use this interface, you will need to have Python and pip installed. Additionally, you will need to install the following dependencies: rich, websocket, websocket-client, and halo. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can launch the chat interface by running the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m main
```

Please note that launching the chat interface expects to find the Cheshire Cat Core at `localhost:1865`. In the future, we plan to add configuration options for various aspects of the Cheshire Cat, such as the LLM and embedder choices, LLM API key, Cheshire Cat API key, different Cheshire Cat core ports, and the ability to choose a username for both the user and the cat.
